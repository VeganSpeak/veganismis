		<p>At its core, veganism is a combination of animal liberation and the ancient belief of nonviolence known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ahimsa</a>.</p>

		<blockquote class="sm:w-4/5 not-italic">
			<p>We can see quite plainly that our present civilisation is built on the exploitation of animals, just as past civilisations were built on the exploitation of slaves, and we believe the spiritual destiny of man is such that in time he will view with abhorrence the idea that men once fed on the products of animals’ bodies.</p>
			<cite class="text-base not-italic">Donald Watson, (Founder, The Vegan Society, 1944)</cite>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Veganism is a moral baseline that fully embraces the aspects of humanity that make us unique from other animals; ethics and morality, our intelligence, creativity, and advanced problem-solving abilities. Veganism challenges unethical traditions and encouraging people to think critically about the choices they make and the impact they have in the world.</p>

		<blockquote class="sm:w-4/5 not-italic">
			<p>Veganism is a principle — that man has no right to exploit the creatures for his own ends — and no variation occurs.</p>
			<cite class="text-base not-italic">Leslie Cross, (Vice-President, The Vegan Society, 1951)</cite>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Ultimately the principal of veganism encourages us to use our position of power in a way that benefits all sentient beings and the environment. By choosing to live a vegan lifestyle, individuals can make a meaningful difference in the world, and contribute to the creation of a more compassionate and sustainable future.</p>

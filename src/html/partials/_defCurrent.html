				<dd x-disclosure:panel x-collapse x-cloak>Despite the common misconception veganism is more than a dietary choice; it is a philosophy advocating for the ethical treatment of all living beings and the promotion of environmental sustainability. As a way of living, veganism involves making choices in all aspects of life that align with these values, such as abstaining from animal-derived products in <a href="https://www.eatfair.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">food</a>, <a href="https://www.animal-ethics.org/animals-used-for-clothing-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clothing</a>, <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/animal-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beauty products</a>, and other consumer goods, services and <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/animals-in-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traditions</a>.</dd>

		<p>Overall, the Vegan Society definition of veganism reflects the belief that it is morally wrong for animals to be exploited for self-interested purposes and that vegans strive to avoid all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty as much as possible in their daily lives despite the challenges of living in a non-vegan world.</p>

		<p>At its core, veganism is rooted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ancient belief of ahimsa</a>, which is the principle of nonviolence and compassion towards all living beings.</p>

		<p>Ahimsa, which has been a central tenet of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism for thousands of years, encourages the belief that all living beings have the right to live their lives free from harm and suffering. This belief is reflected in veganism, which seeks to eliminate the exploitation and cruelty that animals often face in industries such as <a href="https://www.eatfair.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">farming</a>, <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/animal-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animal testing</a>, and the <a href="https://www.animal-ethics.org/animals-used-for-clothing-introduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clothing</a> and <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/animals-in-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entertainment industries</a>.</p>

		<p>Veganism is also a progressive philosophy that embraces humanity's unique concepts of ethics, our intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving abilities while challenging traditions and encouraging people to think critically about the choices they make and the impact they have on other beings.</p>

		<p>Ultimately, veganism is a choice that reflects the best of what it means to be human. It recognizes our capacity for compassion, empathy, and understanding, and it encourages us to use our position of power and technology in a way that benefits all beings and the environment. By choosing to live a vegan lifestyle, individuals can make a meaningful difference in the world, and contribute to the creation of a more compassionate and sustainable future.</p>

We simply hope that by limiting the range of meanings of the term “veganism,” the term retains a simplicity, communicability, and accessibility that provides analytical clarity and coherence for scholars and commentators, and assists in communication about individual actions and within advocacy efforts whose success depends on the mass and sustained participation of disparate actors whose “veganism” is primarily enacted in a disaggregated fashion in the marketplace.”</blockquote>

However, it encourages vegans to do everything possible to minimize their impact on animals and to seek out alternatives whenever possible.</dd></dl><dl id="animals"><dt class="font-bold">“Exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals”</dt><dd>refers to the core belief that it is wrong to use animals for human benefit, whether it is for food, clothing, entertainment, or any other purpose. This includes exploiting animals for their labor or using them for medical or scientific experimentation.</dd></dl><dl id="purpose"><dt class="font-bold">“For food, clothing or any other purpose”</dt><dd>Covers all areas of life in which animals may be exploited or mistreated. This includes the use of animal products in food, clothing, and other everyday items, as well as activities such as hunting, circuses, and zoos.</dd></dl><dl id="alternatives"><dt class="font-bold">“Promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives”</dt><dd>Means that vegans not only seek to avoid using animal products, but also actively support the development and use of alternatives to animal products. This can include supporting companies that produce plant-based or synthetic products, as well as researching and developing new animal-free alternatives.</dd></dl></div><p>Overall, the Vegan Society's definition of veganism reflects the belief that it is wrong to use animals to satisfy human desires and that vegans strive to avoid all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty as much as possible in their daily lives despite living in a non-vegan world.</p></div></div><div x-tabs:panel x-cloak class="sm:pt-12 md:pb-32 lg:px-16 lg:space-y-16 2xl:space-y-32 md:space-y-12 min-h-screen p-8 pb-24 space-y-8"><div class="lg:grid-cols-6 lg:gap-16 border-black/20 md:gap-4 grid border-b"><blockquote class="lg:pb-4 lg:col-span-4 font-semibold sm:font-medium xl:pr-16 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl 2xl:text-5xl sm:text-2xl text-xl !leading-[1.33333] lg:max-w-[60ch]">Veganism is the principle of the emancipation of animals from exploitation by man.</blockquote><p class="lg:order-last lg:col-span-2 lg:prose-lg xl:prose-xl prose-neutral flex items-end pb-4 mt-4 prose">A first official Vegan Society definition from 1949.</p></div><div class="lg:grid-cols-6 lg:gap-16 border-black/20 md:gap-4 grid border-b"><blockquote class="lg:pb-4 lg:col-span-4 font-semibold sm:font-medium xl:pr-16 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl 2xl:text-5xl sm:text-2xl text-xl !leading-[1.33333] lg:max-w-[60ch]">To seek an end to the use of animals by man for food, commodities, work, hunting, vivisection, and by all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man.<p></p></blockquote><p class="lg:order-last lg:col-span-2 xl:prose-xl prose-neutral flex items-end pb-4 mt-4 prose prose-lg">Later this was clarified with more detail.</p></div></div><div x-tabs:panel x-cloak class="md:space-y-8 sm:pt-12 md:pb-32 lg:px-16 min-h-screen p-8 pb-24 space-y-4"><p class="border-black/20 lg:prose-lg prose-neutral max-w-none pb-4 prose border-b">In 2021 <a href="http://www.jandutkiewicz.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jan Dutkiewicz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonadickstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Dickstein</a> proposed a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41055-020-00081-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutral definition of Veganism</a>.</p><blockquote class="xl:pr-16 md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl 2xl:text-5xl text-2xl !leading-[1.33333] lg:max-w-[60ch]"><p>Veganism is the <strong class="sm:font-medium font-semibold">abstention from consuming and using animal-derived products</strong>.</p></blockquote><div class="md:pt-12 lg:pt-16 pt-8"><blockquote class="prose-neutral xl:prose-xl prose prose-lg">“Our goal in defending the minimal definition of veganism is not the promotion of either veganism or any particular strategy for promoting veganism, nor is it a critique of any particular strategy for promoting veganism or motivation for arriving at vegan practice. We simply hope that by limiting the range of meanings of the term “veganism,” the term retains a simplicity, communicability, and accessibility that provides analytical clarity and coherence for scholars and commentators, and assists in communication about individual actions and within advocacy efforts whose success depends on the mass and sustained participation of disparate actors whose “veganism” is primarily enacted in a disaggregated fashion in the marketplace.”</blockquote></div></div><div x-tabs:panel x-cloak class="md:space-y-8 sm:pt-12 md:pb-32 lg:px-16 min-h-screen p-8 pb-24 space-y-4"><h2 class="xl:pr-16 md:text-4xl text-3xl xl:text-5xl !leading-[1.33333] lg:max-w-[60ch] font-semibold sm:font-medium">Veganism is not a diet.</h2><div class="prose-neutral md:pt-12 lg:pt-16 xl:prose-xl pt-8 space-y-8 prose prose-lg"><p>At its core, veganism is rooted in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ancient belief of ahimsa</a>, which is the principle of nonviolence and compassion towards all living beings.</p><p>Ahimsa, which has been a central tenet of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism for thousands of years, encourages the belief that all living beings have the right to live their lives free from harm and suffering.

It recognizes our capacity for compassion, empathy, and understanding, and it encourages us to use our position of power and technology in a way that benefits all beings and the environment. By choosing to live a vegan lifestyle, individuals can make a meaningful difference in the world, and contribute to the creation of a more compassionate and sustainable future.</p></div></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://unpkg.com/@alpinejs/ui@3.10.5-beta.8/dist/cdn.min.js"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://unpkg.com/@alpinejs/focus@3.10.5/dist/cdn.min.js"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://unpkg.com/alpinejs@3.10.5/dist/cdn.min.js"></script></body></html>

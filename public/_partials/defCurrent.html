		Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practicable — all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

		<p>This original and most widely accepted definition of veganism — from <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Vegan Society</a> — encapsulates both the practice and philosophy of veganism.</p>

		<p>There are several key points made in this definition:</p>

		<div class="space-y-4">
			<dl id="philosophy">
				<dt class="font-bold">“A philosophy and way of living”</dt>
				<dd>Refers to the fact that veganism is not merely a diet or a set of beliefs, but rather a lifestyle that encompasses many different aspects of an individual's life.</dd>
			</dl>

			<dl id="possible">
				<dt class="font-bold">“Exclude, as far as is possible and practicable”</dt>
				<dd>Means that vegans should try their best to avoid using or consuming animal products but acknowledges that complete avoidance of animal products may not be possible in all circumstances.</dd>
			</dl>

			<dl id="animals">
				<dt class="font-bold">“Exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals”</dt>
				<dd>refers to the core belief that it is wrong to use animals for human benefit, whether it is for food, clothing, entertainment, or any other purpose. This includes exploiting animals for their labor or using them for medical or scientific experimentation.</dd>
			</dl>

			<dl id="purpose">
				<dt class="font-bold">“For food, clothing or any other purpose”</dt>
				<dd>Covers all areas of life in which animals may be exploited or mistreated. This includes the use of animal products in food, clothing, and other everyday items, as well as activities such as hunting, circuses, and zoos.</dd>
			</dl>

			<dl id="alternatives">
				<dt class="font-bold">“Promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives”</dt>
				<dd>Means that vegans not only seek to avoid using animal products, but also actively support the development and use of alternatives to animal products. This can include supporting companies that produce plant-based or synthetic products, as well as researching and developing new animal-free alternatives.</dd>
			</dl>
		</div>

		<p>Overall, the Vegan Society's definition of veganism reflects the belief that it is wrong to use animals to satisfy human desires and that vegans strive to avoid all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty as much as possible in their daily lives despite living in a non-vegan world.</p>
